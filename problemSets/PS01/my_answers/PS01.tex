\section*{Question 1} 
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test uses cumulative distribution statistics test the similarity of the empirical distribution of some observed data and a specified PDF, and serves as a goodness of fit test. The test statistic is created by:

$$D = \max_{i=1:n} \Big\{ \frac{i}{n}  - F_{(i)}, F_{(i)} - \frac{i-1}{n} \Big\}$$

\noindent where $F$ is the theoretical cumulative distribution of the distribution being tested and $F_{(i)}$ is the $i$th ordered value. Intuitively, the statistic takes the largest absolute difference between the two distribution functions across all $x$ values. Large values indicate dissimilarity and the rejection of the hypothesis that the empirical distribution matches the queried theoretical distribution. The p-value is calculated from the Kolmogorov-
Smirnoff CDF:

$$p(D \leq d)= \frac{\sqrt {2\pi}}{d} \sum _{k=1}^{\infty }e^{-(2k-1)^{2}\pi ^{2}/(8d^{2})}$$


\noindent which generally requires approximation methods (see \href{https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25787785.pdf}{Marsaglia, Tsang, and Wang 2003}). This so-called non-parametric test (this label comes from the fact that the distribution of the test statistic does not depend on the distribution of the data being tested) performs poorly in small samples, but works well in a simulation environment. Write an \texttt{R} function that implements this test where the reference distribution is normal. Using \texttt{R} generate 1,000 Cauchy random variables (\texttt{rcauchy(1000, location = 0, scale = 1)}) and perform the test (remember, use the same seed, something like \texttt{set.seed(123)}, whenever you're generating your own data).\\
	
	
\noindent As a hint, you can create the empirical distribution and theoretical CDF using this code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
	# create empirical distribution of observed data
	ECDF <- ecdf(data)
	empiricalCDF <- ECDF(data)
	# generate test statistic
	D <- max(abs(empiricalCDF - pnorm(data))) \end{lstlisting}

\vspace{3in}

	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=38, lastline=55]{PS01.R} 
	
	\textit {The code first ensures that data refers to a numeric vector rather than a function, then creates the empirical cumulative distribution function ECDF for the observed data. A custom function, ks normal test, is defined to perform a Kolmogorov–Smirnov  test against a normal distribution. Within this function, the KS statistic D is calculated as the maximum absolute difference between the empirical CDF and the theoretical normal CDF, and the corresponding p-value is approximated using the Kolmogorov distribution. The test is then applied to 1,000 randomly generated Cauchy values. The resulting large D and small p-value indicate a substantial deviation from normality, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed.}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item D = $0.1347281$
		\item p.value = $3.425363 \times 10^{-16}$
	\end{itemize}
	

\section*{Question 2}
\noindent Estimate an OLS regression in \texttt{R} that uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm (specifically \texttt{BFGS}, which is a quasi-Newton method), and show that you get the equivalent results to using \texttt{lm}. Use the code below to create your data.
